git branch - every branch has their own code copy
we use this concept where multiple users work on a single app code where they works on diff-diff services we use the branch concept in this concept they can work on their code in a isolated and seperate environment after testing the code is this working in a right way or not we merge the code in main branch 

basically we can divide the code in multiple segments for working smoothly.

git branch - list output all the branches which are present in working directory .

git branch dev - create a new branch which name is dev

git switch - switch between one branch to another branch

git checkout -b stage - it create a branch which name is stage and also shifted to stage branch

git merge - merge two branches with their data

head - latest commit of the branch

git fetch - push the remote branches to local use fetch 
and pull used to copy the data that branch
